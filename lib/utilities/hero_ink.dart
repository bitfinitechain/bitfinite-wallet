/// **Always white, in every theme, by design direction.** The hero is the
/// product's signature surface and reads as one thing across the whole theme
/// set; flipping it to dark ink on the lighter fills (Orange `#F36B43`,
/// Fruit Sorbet `#F95369`, OLED Black `#F26822`) broke that and was rejected.
///
/// This is a deliberate override of contrast, not an oversight: white on
/// Orange measures 3.00:1. It is kept in a function rather than inlined so the
/// rule has one home and one place to change if that call is ever revisited.

/// Ink for content on any *other* filled surface — dock pills, the dock itself.
///
/// Unlike the hero, these are not a brand statement, and unreadable text here
/// is a defect rather than a style. The rule is "trust the theme, verify the
/// result": a theme's declared ink is used as-is, and replaced only when it
/// actually fails against the surface it lands on.
///
/// This exists because tokens can disagree with reality. The Orange theme sets
/// `bottom_nav_text` and `popup_bg` to the *same* `#FFFFFF`, so its inactive
/// nav label was painted in the dock's own background — 1.00:1, invisible.
/// No amount of trusting the token fixes that.
///
/// The 4.0 floor sits just under the 4.5 AA line on purpose. Forest puts white
/// at 4.41:1, which reads correctly and was signed off; snapping at 4.5 would
/// restyle Forest over a 0.09 difference. Only genuine failures are replaced.

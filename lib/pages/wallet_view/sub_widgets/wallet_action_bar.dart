/// Redesign of the wallet home's bottom controls: two full-width buttons —
/// Receive and Send — instead of the floating icon dock.
///
/// The coin-conditional actions the dock carried (Finalize, Sign, Swap, Buy,
/// Names, Tokens, …) are not dropped: whatever the wallet declares beyond
/// Receive/Send goes into a "more" sheet behind a third compact button, which
/// simply does not render for wallets that have nothing extra — the common
/// case, which then matches the mockups exactly. Hiding a working feature to
/// match a picture would be a regression, not a redesign.
///
/// On a view-only wallet Send renders locked rather than absent: the wallet
/// deliberately cannot sign, and a control that explains that beats one that
/// vanished. Tapping it says so instead of doing nothing.
///
/// Colour comes from the theme, not the coin. Chrome — buttons, links,
/// switches, the sync chip — is one set of controls that happens to be showing
/// a coin, so it stays put as you move between wallets; the coin colour is
/// reserved for the marks that identify the coin itself (its icon and its card
/// on the home list). Recolouring the accent per coin meant every theme's
/// contrast pairing had to be re-earned for each coin, which is how a
/// white-on-gold Save button shipped.

    // An opaque bar with a short gradient above it is the fix and is also

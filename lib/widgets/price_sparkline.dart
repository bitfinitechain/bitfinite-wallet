/*
 * A 7-day price sparkline, drawn from the series CoinGecko already returns
 * alongside the price. Hand-painted rather than pulling in a charting package:
 * one line and one fill needs no dependency, and a package would bring axes,
 * legends and tooltips this has no room for.
 *
 * Touch it and it reports: a crosshair, the point under your finger, and the
 * price and age of that point. A chart with no readout is a shape, not a
 * figure — you can see that it rose without ever learning what it rose to.
 *
 * Renders nothing when there is no series. BFX has no market, so it has no
 * series, and an empty chart frame would read as broken rather than as "not
 * applicable".

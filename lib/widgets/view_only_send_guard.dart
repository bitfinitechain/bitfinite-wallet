/*
 * Refuses a send screen for a wallet that cannot sign.
 *
 * Hiding the Send control is a convention: it holds only as long as every place
 * that can reach the send flow remembers to check. That already failed once —
 * the wallet view gated its dock item on `!viewOnly` while the Receive/Send
 * dock did not, so opening Receive on a watched address put Send straight back
 * on screen.
 *
 * This is the guarantee behind that convention. It sits on the route, so the
 * send form cannot be reached whatever pushes it: a dock that forgets the
 * check, a deep link, a restored navigation stack, or a screen added later.
 *
 * It explains rather than bounces. Popping on sight would look like a crash or
 * a dead tap, and the person did not do anything wrong — the wallet simply has
 * no keys.
